# scattered-scatterplot

These code examples accompany the video course “[An Introduction to d3.js: From Scattered to Scatterplot](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/110000632.do)”.

**NOTE:** Since that video was recorded, I have updated these files with a newer version of D3 (3.5.6).  Everything you see in the video is still accurate, but you will notice that `src` links in the HTML now point to `d3.js` instead of `d3.v3.js`, as seen in the video.

These examples have also been used for similar workshops, which were presented on:

- 2015 July 21 at [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/42458) in Portland, Oregon
- 2014 August 29 at [The Graphical Web](http://graphicalweb.org/2014/) in Winchester, England
- 2014 February 11 at the [Strata Conference](http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/32866) in Santa Clara, California
- 2014 January 8 as an [O’Reilly Webcast](http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/2952)

Inline versions of these examples are also hosted on Atlas (no download required):

- [All inline examples](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000002001/ch01.html)
- [Presentation slides with inline examples](http://scatteredtoscatterplot.strataconf.com) (experimental!)

Some of these examples are adapted from the sample code files for *Interactive Data Visualization for the Web* (O’Reilly, March 2013).
